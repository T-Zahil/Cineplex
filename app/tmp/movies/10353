Godefroy de Montmirail travels to today to recover the missing family jewels and a sacred relic, guarantor of his wife-to-be's fertility. The confrontation between Godefroy's repellent servant Jack the Crack and his descendent, the effete Jacquart, present-day owner of the chateau, further complicates the matter.","popularity":0.492987,"poster_path":"/w8JwWuXR43N1SapEVnU1hWoxJNd.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Gaumont","id":9},{"name":"Canal+","id":5358},{"name":"France 3 Cinema","id":16804},{"name":"Centre National de la Cinématographie (CNC)","id":18367}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They come back!","title":"The Visitors II: The Corridors of Time","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":75}
